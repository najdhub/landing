# Post-Mortem & Lessons Learned: CI/CD Secret Injection for Cloudflare Workers

**Date:** 2025-05-30
**Project:** Najd Commercial Hub (Cloudflare Worker & Pages)
**Issue:** Secrets (e.g., `MAILCHANNELS_API_KEY`) were not being correctly injected into environment-specific Cloudflare Workers (`najd-contact-handler-dev`, `najd-contact-handler-prod`) via the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline. Instead, they were being applied to a base worker name (`najd-contact-handler`).

## 1. Summary of the Problem

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) using `cloudflare/wrangler-action@v3` was configured to deploy Cloudflare Workers for different environments (`dev`, `production`). These environments had distinct worker names defined in `wrangler.toml` (e.g., `najd-contact-handler-dev`).

The initial attempts to pass secrets to the action using the `secrets: |` input resulted in the secrets being uploaded, but to a worker named `najd-contact-handler` (derived from the top-level `name` in `wrangler.toml`), not the intended environment-specific worker (e.g., `najd-contact-handler-dev`). This led to the worker code failing at runtime due to missing critical API keys.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

The primary root causes were:

1.  **Misunderstanding of `cloudflare/wrangler-action` Behavior for Secrets with Environments:**
    *   The `wrangler-action`'s mechanism for uploading secrets (which internally uses `wrangler secret bulk` or similar) did not automatically infer the environment-specific worker name solely from the `--env <environment>` flag passed to the `deploy` command within the `command` input.
    *   An initial attempt to use an undocumented `name` input within the `with:` block of the action was incorrect, as this input is not supported by `cloudflare/wrangler-action@v3` for specifying the secret target worker.

2.  **Default Worker Naming for Secret Operations:**
    *   When no specific target worker name was effectively communicated to the secret uploading portion of the action, it defaulted to using the top-level `name` defined in `wrangler.toml` (i.e., `najd-contact-handler`). Wrangler then prompted (in a non-interactive CI context, using a fallback 'yes') to create this worker if it didn't exist and applied secrets to it.

3.  **Node.js Version Incompatibility (Secondary Issue):**
    *   The GitHub Actions runner was initially using Node.js v18, while newer versions of Wrangler (which the action might install or attempt to use) recommend or require Node.js v20+. This could lead to subtle incompatibilities or reliance on older Wrangler behavior within the action.

## 3. Resolution Steps

The issue was resolved by making the following key changes to `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

1.  **Explicitly Use the `environment` Input for `cloudflare/wrangler-action`:**
    *   The `environment` input was added to the `with:` block for each worker deployment step.
        *   For development: `environment: 'dev'`
        *   For production: `environment: 'production'`
    *   This allowed the `cloudflare/wrangler-action` to correctly associate the secrets being uploaded with the configuration (and thus the `name`) defined in the corresponding `[env.<name>]` section of `wrangler.toml`.

2.  **Simplified `command` Input:**
    *   The `command` input was changed from `deploy --env <environment_name>` to simply `deploy`. The `--env` flag is now correctly inferred by the action from the `environment` input.

3.  **Update Node.js Version in CI:**
    *   The Node.js version in the GitHub Actions workflow was updated to `node-version: '20'` to align with modern Wrangler requirements.

**Example of the corrected `deploy.yml` snippet for the development worker:**
```yaml
      - name: Deploy Worker to Development
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
        uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@v3
        env: # GitHub secrets made available to the runner
          MAILCHANNELS_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.MAILCHANNELS_API_KEY }}
          DEV_ADMIN_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.DEV_ADMIN_EMAIL }}
          DEV_FROM_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.DEV_FROM_EMAIL }}
        with:
          apiToken: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
          accountId: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID }}
          environment: 'dev' # Crucial for targeting the correct worker for secrets
          command: deploy
          secrets: | # Secrets from runner env to be uploaded to CF Worker
            MAILCHANNELS_API_KEY
            DEV_ADMIN_EMAIL
            DEV_FROM_EMAIL
```

4.  **Cleanup:** The incorrectly created `najd-contact-handler` worker was manually deleted from the Cloudflare dashboard.

## 4. Lessons Learned

1.  **Action-Specific Inputs are Key:** Always consult the specific documentation for the GitHub Action being used (`cloudflare/wrangler-action` in this case). Assumptions about common input names (like `name` for targeting) can be misleading.
2.  **Environment Context for Secrets:** When using Cloudflare Worker environments that result in different worker names, ensure the CI/CD mechanism for setting secrets is also environment-aware and targets the correct, environment-specific worker instance. The `environment` input for `wrangler-action` is vital for this.
3.  **GitHub Actions Logs are Your Best Friend:** Detailed examination of the GitHub Actions workflow logs (especially the output of the `wrangler-action` and the `wrangler` commands it executes) is crucial for diagnosing CI/CD issues. The logs clearly showed which worker was being targeted for secret uploads.
4.  **Local Testing vs. CI/CD Testing:**
    *   Local testing with `wrangler dev` and `.dev.vars` is good for worker *code* logic.
    *   However, testing the CI/CD pipeline's behavior (especially secret injection and action-specific logic) often requires actual pipeline runs.
5.  **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Using outdated Node.js versions or Wrangler versions can lead to unexpected behavior or missing features. Regularly update CI environments and project dependencies.
6.  **Iterative Debugging:** CI/CD issues often require an iterative approach: make a change, push, observe logs, adjust.
7.  **Clean Up Erroneous Resources:** If misconfigurations create unintended resources (like the extra worker), clean them up promptly to avoid confusion and maintain a tidy environment.

## 5. Action Items / Future Prevention

*   **Documentation:** Keep this document updated if similar issues arise or new patterns are discovered.
*   **Standard Practice:** When configuring new CI/CD steps for Cloudflare Workers with environments, always verify that both code deployment *and* secret/variable injection target the correct environment-specific worker.
*   **Regularly Review Action Versions:** Periodically check for newer versions of `cloudflare/wrangler-action` and review their changelogs for improved or altered behavior regarding environments and secrets.
*   **Add CI Step for Wrangler Version Check/Update:** Consider adding a dedicated step in the CI to install/update Wrangler to a specific desired version to ensure consistency, rather than relying solely on pre-installed or action-installed versions.
